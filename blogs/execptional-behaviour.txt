# Exceptional behaviour in customer service

I am writing this as a bunch of annecdotes when I like what a customer facing personnel did which touched me deeply, these will be small gestures not something out of the world.

## 1. Jockey

Me, Prasad and Nishkarsh had did a lot of shopping from zudio but the zudio people had only given us a weak and fragile bag and had put the things anyways in it. On the way to Jockey one of the handle of it broke. We somehow made it to Jockey. There after a long time nishkarsh purchaged an underware, the staff who was showing him underware was not so good and was ignoring him in favour of other customers.
